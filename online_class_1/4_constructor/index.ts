// If parent class provide constructor(with or without argument)

// Below code will not work because it does not call super,

// Case 1:
// If parent class provide constructor and child class does not
// provide then child class will use parent's constrcutor
// and child's object creation will required use of parent's 
//constructor parameters

let d: B = new B("C");   // Thsi is also not working

// If parent class does not provide constructor and child class provide constrcutor then 
// child class must call super() within child's class constructor

// they are in parent's constructor call to super
