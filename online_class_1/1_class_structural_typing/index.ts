//A confusion about Structural Typing:

//Object literals have an associated freshness before 
//they're bound to a variable. The same doesn't apply 
//for any other expressions.

//The idea is that object literals are often used for option bags 
//(where the user has to manually type out each property 
//name at each use-site), and this behavior catches typos.

//If you'd like to prevent Animal from being assigned to a Human, 
//you can add a private property to Animal, 
//since private and protected properties need to originate
// from the same declaration to be compatible.

class Human {
    
    name: string;
    
    constructor(name: string){
        this.name = name;
    }
}

class Animal {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    
    constructor(name: string, age: number){
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
    // eat(){
    //     console.log(this.name + " is a Human and is eating");
    // }
}

let h1 = new Human("wania");
let a1 = new Animal("world", 50);

//this is working, but it should not because it is 
//a fresh object with extra properties 
h1 = new Animal("test", 25); //no error

a1 = new Human("zeeshan");//ERROR

//my common sense is saying this is correct, but?

// let a = {name: "Zia"};
let a = {name: "Zeeshan", age: 22};


//It seems that for object literals there is a rule for 
//fresh objects but this rules does not apply to 
//normal objects derived from classes
